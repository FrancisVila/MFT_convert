}Log into your server with all checklist items readily available.

1.  Open a browser.
2.  Enter `https://<servername>:<portnumber>` where `<servername>` is the name or IP address of the server you want to configure and `<portnumber>` is the SSL port number you assigned to the Administration Tool during installation. The default port number is `444` or `8444` if <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">SecureTransport</span> is running as a non-root user.
3.  Following the instructions for your browser, add a certificate exception for the <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">SecureTransport</span> instance.
4.  Enter the setup user name and password. The default setup user name is `setup` and the default password is `setup`.
