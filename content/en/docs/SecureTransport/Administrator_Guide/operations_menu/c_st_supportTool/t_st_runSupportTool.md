}The support tool is implemented as an executable script. To create the support information file, run `<FILEDRIVEHOME>/bin/collect_support_information`. The script saves the information configured on the *Support Tool Configuration* page in the configured output directory. The file name is `support_<supportAccessCode>_<hostName>_<timestamp>.tar.gz where`:

-   `<supportAccessCode>` is the value of the **Support Access Code** field on the *Support Tool Configuration* page.
-   `<hostName>` is the host name of the system that the support tool is run on.
-   `<timestamp>`Â is the UNIX time (the number of seconds that have elapsed since midnight Coordinated Universal Time on January 1, 1970).

To write the support information file to a different directory from the one specified in the **Output Directory** field on the *Support Tool Configuration* page, use the following command:

`<FILEDRIVEHOME>/bin/collect_support_information -d <outputDirectory>`

If the output directory does not exist, the support tool creates it.

The support tool can run when the SecureTransport database in not available, but it cannot collect the following information that is stored in the database:

-   Server log
-   File tracking
-   Audit log
-   Server configuration

During execution, the support tool outputs status messages and a final message that path name of the support information file. You can use SecureTransport to push the file to another location.

## Run the support tool automatically when the TM runs out of memory

You can configure SecureTransport to run the support tool automatically when the Transaction Manager (TM) fails with an `OutOfMemoryError`. SecureTransport runs the support tool before it restarts the TM.

1.  Edit the `<FILEDRIVEHOME>/bin/crash_tm` file and comment out a line so that it is:  
    `# collect_crash_info="false"`
2.  If **Collect TM heap dump** is selected on the *Support Tool Configuration* page, edit the `<FILEDRIVEHOME>/bin/start_tm_console` file and comment out a line so that it is:  
    `# disableHeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError="true"`
3.  Restart the Transaction Manager on all clustered SecureTransport Servers or all synchronized SecureTransport Edge servers using the `stop_tm` and `start_tm` commands in `<FILEDRIVEHOME>/bin`.

SecureTransport runs the support tool using the configuration from the *Support Tool Configuration* page.
