}{{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} Edge is the gateway required in the perimeter network (also called demilitarized zone or DMZ) in a typical multilayer security architecture deployment. You can use {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} Edge to implement secure interactions between client systems in a public or other external network and {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} Servers in your internal secure network.

{{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} Edge serves as a protocol converter in such a deployment. It treats a wide range of file transfer protocols as presentation layer services and each protocol server translates its protocol onto the streaming protocol used to communicate with the Transaction Manager (TM) server on the {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} Server. The TM Server connects to the protocol servers on the configured {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} Edge servers to establish the connections for the streaming protocol, so no process on a {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} Edge ever makes a connection from the DMZ into the internal secure network. A flexible network zone configuration supports connection to the protocol servers on specific {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} Edge servers for different protocols and file transfers. For more information see <a href="../../c_st_setup/c_st_networkzones" class="MCXref xref">Communication across Transaction Manager, protocol, and proxy servers</a>.

{{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} Edge serves all the protocols supported by {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}}. When an external partner client program or file transfer server initiates a connection to one of the protocol servers hosted on {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} Edge, it terminates the inbound connection from the client, collects the client’s credentials, and establishes an authenticated encrypted connection to the TM. {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} Edge sends the credentials to the TM as a service request. The TM attempts to authenticate the account using the configured method and returns the result to {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} Edge. If the account is authenticated, {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} Edge establishes the connection.

For a file transfer, {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} Edge uses the streaming protocol to check the access control rules on {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} Server to authorize the transfer. {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} Edge converts the network messages between the client protocol and the {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} streaming protocol, decrypting and encrypting the data as needed. The data is *streamed* between the external-facing protocol server and the Transaction Manager, the streaming protocol server, running on the {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} Server. No transferred file data is stored in the {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} Edge file system in the perimeter network.

When {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} Server connects to a partner server in the external network to check for files or to transfer a file, it can use the SOCKS5 circuit-level proxy component of {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} Edge to broker the connection through the perimeter network to the external network. Thus, the authentication credentials exist only in the internal secure network and are encrypted until they are presented to the external server. ({{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} Server can also use an HTTP proxy.)

{{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} Edge is available as software on Windows and UNIX platforms. You can deploy it with stand-alone or clustered {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} Servers. You can deploy two or more {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} Edge systems in support of a {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} Server cluster and synchronize configuration changes dynamically. Each {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} Edge stores its configuration in a local embedded database.
