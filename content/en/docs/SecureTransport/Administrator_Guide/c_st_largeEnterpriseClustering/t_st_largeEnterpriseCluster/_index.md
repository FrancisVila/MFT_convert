}As described in [Cluster models](../../overview/c_st_deploy_models#Clusteri), an Enterprise Cluster is a {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} deployment that uses a collection of servers at a single site to provide the capacity to handle a very large file transfer workload. All {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} Server systems in the cluster share an external database and a file system. This topic describes how to set up and maintain an Enterprise Cluster (EC). These operations are available only on the {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} Server.

The following topics provide the prerequisites and how-to instructions for managing an Enterprise Cluster:

-   [Enterprise Cluster prerequisites](c_st_cluster_prerequisites) - Provides the Enterprise Cluster prerequisites.
-   [Set up a cluster](t_st_setup_cluster) - Provides the how-to instructions for setting up an Enterprise Cluster.
-   [Add a server to a cluster](t_st_add_server_to_cluster) - Provides the how-to instructions for adding a server to an Enterprise Cluster.
-   [Remove a server from a cluster](t_st_remove_server_from_cluster) - Provides the how-to instructions for removing a server from an Enterprise Cluster.
-   [View cluster status](t_st_view_cluster_status) - Provide the how-to instructions for view the status of an Enterprise Cluster.
-   [Notification of cluster status](t_st_notification_of_cluster_status) - Provides the how-to instructions for setting up email notification of cluster status.
-   [Set up a disaster recovery cluster](t_st_setup_disaster_recovery_cluster) - Provides the how-to instructions for setting up a disaster recovery cluster.
-   [Maintain a disaster recovery cluster](t_st_maintain_disaster_recovery_cluster) - Describes maintaining a disaster recovery cluster.
-   [Disaster recovery failover and fallback](t_st_dr_failover_fallback) - Describes disaster recovery site failover and fallback.
-   [Direct cluster workload](t_st_direct_cluster_workload) - Describes balancing the direct cluster workload and provides how-to instructions for balancing the workload.
