}When you create or edit an administrator account you can set an administrative role that defines the accountâ€™s privileges and permissions in the Administration Tool. You can create multiple administrators whose account management capabilities are based on administrative roles you create. Each role can have different account management capabilities. Use the *Administrative Roles* page on the {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} Server to create the roles and assign administrative privileges.

For each role, you control:

-   Role type
-   Permission to bounce servers
-   Access to {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname >}} menus and submenus
