}When you create or edit an administrator account you can set an administrative role that defines the accountâ€™s privileges and permissions in the Administration Tool. You can create multiple administrators whose account management capabilities are based on administrative roles you create. Each role can have different account management capabilities. Use the *Administrative Roles* page on the <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">SecureTransport</span> Server to create the roles and assign administrative privileges.

For each role, you control:

-   Role type
-   Permission to bounce servers
-   Access to <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">SecureTransport</span> menus and submenus
