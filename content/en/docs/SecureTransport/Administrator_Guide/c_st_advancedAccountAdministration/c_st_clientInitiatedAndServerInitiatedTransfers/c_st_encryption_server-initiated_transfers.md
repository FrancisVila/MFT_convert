}When {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} performs server-initiated transfers, it defines user classes by UID and GID only â€“ no user name is specified. As a result, if you use `EncryptClass` for encrypting or decrypting transferred files and `EncryptClass` is defined only by user name, the following is true:

-   Encrypted files transferred using a server-initiated upload are decrypted before the start of the transfer.
-   Files transferred using a server-initiated download are transferred with encryption.
