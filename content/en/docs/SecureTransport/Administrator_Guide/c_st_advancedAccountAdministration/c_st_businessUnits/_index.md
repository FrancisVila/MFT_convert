}Use business units to encapsulate certain information necessary for transfers into a single entity. When you create accounts and templates, you can specify a business unit to represent a particular set of information about the transfer. When you create a delegated administrator, you can specify business units (including users assigned to that business unit) to be managed by the delegated administrator. For more information, see <a href="../c_st_delegatedadministration#Advanced_Accounts_2036285406_1117693" class="MCXref xref">Delegated administration</a>.

The information contained in a business unit includes business unit name, base folder, a parent business unit, whether administrators are allowed to modify the base folder or the home folder, and which HTML template to use when users belonging to this business unit log in using the web client.

Use the *Business Units* page to see the available business units, search the list, delete business units, and invoke the editing process.

Use the *Business Units Settings* page to edit settings for a business unit.

> **Note:**

> Only master administrators and delegated administrators with permissions for managing business units can create and delete business units and modify business a business unit's properties.
