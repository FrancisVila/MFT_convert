}You can limit access to the <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">SecureTransport</span> Administration Tool, FTP,Â and HTTP servers to specified hosts by defining access rules.

When a client attempts to connect to the <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">SecureTransport</span> Administration Tool or either of the protocol servers, the server looks up the address and, if reverse DNS lookup is enabled, the host name of the computer the client is connecting from and for protocol servers, the user class and applies the access rules to allow or deny access.

If your <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">SecureTransport</span> deployment includes <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">SecureTransport</span> Edge servers in a peripheral network (DMZ) and if you need different Administration Tool access control for administrators who use the Administration Tool for <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">SecureTransport</span> Edge and for <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">SecureTransport</span> Server, you can configure Administration Tool access control differently.

Configure protocol server access control on <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">SecureTransport</span> Server only.
