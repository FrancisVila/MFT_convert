}Use this configuration to deny access to <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">SecureTransport</span> to individual users and to users who are members of a group.

By default, the rules deny access to the user `root` and the group `daemon`.

User and group access restrictions apply only to the FTP and HTTP servers.

If your <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">SecureTransport</span> deployment includes <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">SecureTransport</span> Edge servers in a peripheral network (DMZ) and if you need different user and group access for users who connect using <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">SecureTransport</span> Edge and using <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">SecureTransport</span> Server, you can configure user and group access rules differently.
