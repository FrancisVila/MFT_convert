}Use this configuration to deny access to {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} to individual users and to users who are members of a group.

By default, the rules deny access to the user `root` and the group `daemon`.

User and group access restrictions apply only to the FTP and HTTP servers.

If your {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} deployment includes {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} Edge servers in a peripheral network (DMZ) and if you need different user and group access for users who connect using {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} Edge and using {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} Server, you can configure user and group access rules differently.
