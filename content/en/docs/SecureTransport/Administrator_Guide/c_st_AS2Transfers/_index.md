}{{< SecureTransport/componentlongname  >}} supports AS2 (Applicability Statement 2) as the industry standard for Internet-based data exchange.

Use the {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} AS2-certified solution to exchange data with any trading partner using an AS2-interoperable solution over the Internet. AS2 simplifies communication by reducing the number of technologies an organization must support and manage. It would be cost prohibitive for small business partners to exchange data electronically with large organizations that use a different data transport standard. The AS2 standard allows organizations, both large and small, to implement one solution for data exchange with all business partners using an AS2 solution.

The AS2 standard secures data with S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) over HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or HTTPS (secure HTTP over SSL), also using MDN (Message Disposition Notification). AS2 provides synchronous, real-time transmission of data with immediate message delivery notice.

> **Note:**
>
> In Windows, file names of files transferred using the AS2 protocol are limited to 255 characters.

The following topic provides an overview of the AS2 implementation:
