}You must install a core license with ad hoc user licenses included to enable users to compose, send, reply to, or forward messages using ST Web Client or the Axway Email Plug-ins. There are four categories of ad hoc user licenses:

-   **Unlimited ad hoc user licenses**: If your company has purchased an unlimited number of ad hoc user licenses, then the display shows "unlimited" for the number of ad hoc Users.
-   **One ad hoc user license for each account license**: If your company has purchased one ad hoc user license for each account license, then the display shows the same number of licenses for Accounts and for ad hoc users.
-   **Fewer ad hoc user licenses than account licenses**: If your company has purchased fewer ad hoc user licenses than account licenses, then the display shows the maximum number of users that can compose, send, reply to, or forward messages using ST Web Client or one of the Axway Email Plug-ins. One ad hoc user license is consumed the first time a user performs one of these actions.
-   **No ad hoc user licenses**: If your company did not purchase any ad hoc user licenses, then end users cannot use ad hoc file transfers. The display does not include the line with ad hoc users.
