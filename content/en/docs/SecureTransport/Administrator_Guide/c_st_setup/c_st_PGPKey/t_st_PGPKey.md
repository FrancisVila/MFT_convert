}PGP keys are managed from the Administration Tool according to their scope: *local* or *partner*.

-   *Local PGP keys* can be either server-scoped or account-based. To manage server-scoped certificates select **Setup > Certificates** and the *Local Certificates* tab. Account-based certificates are managed from the *Private Certificates* pane of the *Certificates* pane of the *User Account* page. You can use the appropriate page to get detailed information for a particular key, generate a key, delete a key, or export public and private keys.
-   *Partner PGP keys* are also managed by account. You can generate, import, delete, and export account-specific PGP keys. For partner PGP keys, the private key can be exported on certificate creation only. For more information on managing account-based PGP keys, see <a href="../../../accounts/c_st_usercertificates/manage-user-partner-certificates#Import" class="MCXref xref">Use the following procedure to import a partner certificate.</a>

## Generate PGP keys

The two scenarios for generation of PGP keys are:

-   Generate a local key pair and export it into a text file that can be used by the respective partners for encryption of the incoming data. You can export the private key for a local or account private certificate at any time.
-   Generate a partner key pair and export the private key in a file that can be used by the partner for decryption and signing. In this case only the public key is saved and used by <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">SecureTransport</span>. You can save the private key immediately after you generate the key pair. <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">SecureTransport</span> deletes the private key after you save it or decline to save it.

> **Note:**
>
> Partner and local PGP keys are stored in different key rings. Partner keys are account-specific and have a relation to the account, while local keys are not connected to a particular account. To this end, all partner keys are stored in a single key ring and all partner private keys are stored in a corresponding single secret key ring.

<span id="Export"></span>

## Export PGP keys

PGP keys are exported in the format of ASCII-armored key data in compliance with RFC 2440. The data of the exported PGP key is stored directly in a file. The private key of a partner key pair can only be exported when the certificate is first generated by <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">SecureTransport</span>.

<span id="Import"></span>

## Import PGP keys

There are three scenarios for importing PGP keys into <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">SecureTransport</span>:

-   Import a partner PGP public key
-   Import a PGP key pair, generated by a third party, in the set of local keys that applies to all of the <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">SecureTransport</span> system
-   Import a local PGP key pair as a private certificate from the *Private Certificates* pane of the *Certificates* pane of the *User Account* page

> **Note:**
>
> The supported formats of the imported keys are as specified in the RFC 2440 standard: a binary or armored PGP public/private key message.

## Local (server) PGP keys management

Local (server) and partner PGP keys are generated, exported, imported, and deleted for a particular account. See <a href="../../../accounts/c_st_usercertificates" class="MCXref xref">User certificates</a>
