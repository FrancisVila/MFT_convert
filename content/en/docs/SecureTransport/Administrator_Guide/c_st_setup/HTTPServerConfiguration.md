}Use the *HTTP Settings* page to enable and disable HTTP server messages and to configure the Message of the Day functionality. HTTPÂ server messages are displayed to both licensed and unlicensed users after login using the ST Web Client. You can use these messages as notifications, for example, announce dates for planned maintenance. The message text is presented in a pop-up box with a **Do not show again** checkbox and an **OK** button.

The Message of the Day pop-up behavior depends on the current selection of the **Do not show again** checkbox:

-   If selected, the message will not appear again unless you modify it or disable and then re-enable the functionality.
-   If not selected, the message will be displayed every time the user logs in or refreshes the page after login.
