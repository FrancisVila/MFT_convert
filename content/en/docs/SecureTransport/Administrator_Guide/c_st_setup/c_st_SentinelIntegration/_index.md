}Axway Sentinel is a Business Activity Monitoring (BAM) product that collects, aggregates, correlates, and reports events from SecureTransport and other products, applications, and systems throughout your infrastructure. Sentinel is a separate product that you can buy from Axway or an authorized partner. Once you license and configure SecureTransport to send file transfer and processing events to Sentinel, data is collected and displayed on a dashboard.
