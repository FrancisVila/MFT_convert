}{{< SecureTransport/companyname  >}} Sentinel is a Business Activity Monitoring (BAM) product that collects, aggregates, correlates, and reports events from {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} and other products, applications, and systems throughout your infrastructure. Sentinel is a separate product that you can buy from {{< SecureTransport/companyname  >}} or an authorized partner. Once you license and configure {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} to send file transfer and processing events to Sentinel, data is collected and displayed on a dashboard.

> **Note:**
>
> When a SecureTransport Enterprise Cluster (EC) is configured to direct PGP encryption and decryption tasks to one server, Sentinel reporting for a transfer with a PGP task is not accurate because Sentinel cannot combine the processes of the transfer.
