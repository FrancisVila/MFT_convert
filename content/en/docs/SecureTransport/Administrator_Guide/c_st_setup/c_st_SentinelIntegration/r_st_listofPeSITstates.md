## Roles of transfer partners

Although each transfer occurs between only two transfer partners, each transfer partner plays two roles:

-   **Sender** or **Receiver** (the file is sent or received)
-   **Requester** or **Server** (the transfer request is sent or received)

For a given transfer, only the following combinations of partner roles are possible:

-   **Sender/Requester** and **Receiver/Server** (The partner that sent the file requested the transfer).
-   **Receiver/Requester** and **Sender/Server** (The partner that received the file requested the transfer).
