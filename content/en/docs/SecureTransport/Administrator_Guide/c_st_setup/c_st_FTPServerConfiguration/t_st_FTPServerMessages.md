}FTP server messages are messages displayed to users at the startup of an FTP session. Two types of startup FTP server messages are available:

-   [Create or edit the server connect message](#create)
-   [Create or edit the server ready message](#create_edit)

Users might or might not see FTP server messages, depending on the software they use to connect to SecureTransport. Most FTP client applications display these messages, but they are not displayed on browser clients. Users downloading a single file by URL from a browser might not see these messages.

Startup messages are displayed while a connection to the server is being established, prior to any login prompt. A message is displayed to the user when the connection is established. A server ready message also be displayed when SecureTransport is ready to accept a login. The default message displays the host name of the server and the server version, but this can be overridden.
