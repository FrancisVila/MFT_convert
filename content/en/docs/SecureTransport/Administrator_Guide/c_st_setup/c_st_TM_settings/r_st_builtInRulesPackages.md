}SecureTransport ships with several predefined rules packages. These packages contain rules used by SecureTransport as part of the standard functionality of the product. Because these rules and packages are part of the product, it is very important that you do not delete or modify the rules or the rules packages. This topic provides a list of the built-in packages and explains their uses.

## Streaming

The following packages control much of the functionality involved with authenticating users and executing transfers. Streaming and InStreaming packages contain the default functionality optimized for performance in the current release.

-   Streaming
-   InStreaming

## Server-initiated transfers

The following packages call agents when a server-initiated transfer is executed. Each rules package represents a different protocol.

-   FolderTransfer
-   FtpTransfer
-   HttpTransfer
-   Pesit
-   PesitTransfer
-   SshTransfer
-   STAS2

### <span id="ArchiveA"></span>ArchiveAgent

Use this package to archive transferred files. This package is enabled by default. The package copies each transferred file to the archive directory specified in the global File Archiving configuration page. Copied files are renamed to a unique file name to avoid duplicates. The file name format is:

`<File_name><unique_file_name_modifier>`

For example:

`1223375981000_12233759819160.08926095676257206`

The location of the files is as follows:

`<archive_folder>/<account_name>/<login_name>/<relative_path_to_file>/<archived_file>`

Where:

-   `archive_folder` - The archive folder location configured in the global File Archiving configuration page.
-   `account_name` - Name of the account who performed the transfer. When there's no account (for LDAP users for example), account\_name has value of NO\_ACCOUNT.
-   `login_name` - Login name for the user who performed the transfer.
-   `relative_path_to_file` - Path to the file relative to the account's home folder.

For more information, see [Archive Maintenance application](../../../applications/applicationsarchivemaintenance) and [File archiving global configuration](../../c_st_file_archiving/t_st_file_archiving_conf) .

### <span id="Sentinel"></span>Axway Sentinel

This package is enabled by default. SecureTransport uses it to send file transfer and processing events to Axway Sentinel and to call the agent used in a Axway Sentinel Link Data Maintenance application. For more information about configuring SecureTransport to send events to Sentinel, see [Integrate Axway Sentinel](../../c_st_sentinelintegration).

### <span id="ConnectD"></span>ConnectDirectTransfer

Enable this package when you want to create and use a Connect:Direct transfer site. This package is disabled by default. For more information, see [Connect:Direct transfer sites](../../../accounts/transfersites/r_st_connectdirecttransfersites).

### <span id="FileServ"></span>FileServicesInterface

This package is used to implement transfers initiated by SecureTransport using a file services interface protocol.

### <span id="ICAPScan"></span>ICAPScan

This package is used to implement anti-virus or DLP scans initiated by SecureTransport using external ICAP servers. The package is disabled by default and must be enabled if ICAP servers are configured.

### <span id="MDNRecei"></span>MDNReceipting

This package provides functionality to generate MDN receipts for the transferred files. The package is enabled by default.

### <span id="Pesit"></span>Pesit and PesitTransfer

These packages provide the functionality for PeSIT protocol operations, including authentication, server-initiated transfers, client-initiated transfers, routed transfers, and acknowledgments. They are enabled by default.

### <span id="PGPTrans"></span>PGPTransform

In order to use `SendToSite` package, enable it and modify its content. For example, by adding a transfer site name as a value to the Site parameter. For details, refer to [Manage rules packages](../t_st_rulespackages).

SecureTransport includes support for Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) v2 and v3 to help you monitor failed transfers. SecureTransport works with SNMP managers such as Hewlett-Packard OpenView Network Node Manager. You can send messages when file transfers fail after retrying the transfer the number of times allotted. SecureTransport provides a trap MIB file located at `<FILEDRIVEHOME>/conf/Transfer.mib`.
