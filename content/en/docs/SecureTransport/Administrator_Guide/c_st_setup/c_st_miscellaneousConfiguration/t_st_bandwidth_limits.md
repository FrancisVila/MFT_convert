}You can set the global Bandwidth Limits on this panel. You set bandwidth limit for inbound and outbound transfers in kilobytes per second per user account. Apart from global bandwidth limits, you can apply a hierarchy of bandwidth limits on business unit, account template and individual account level.

The hierarchy works in the following way: *global &gt; business unit &gt; account*. Account is on the same level as account template but note that limits set on the account level override global and business unit configurations.

When you add a zero for either limit, no bandwidth limits are applied.
