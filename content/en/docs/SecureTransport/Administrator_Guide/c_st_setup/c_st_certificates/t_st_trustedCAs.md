## Import a trusted CA certificate

A X509 certificate can be imported as a trusted CA in the form of a X509 DER or PEM encoded file. {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} checks the certificate fingerprint before importing. If a certificate with the same fingerprint already exists on the server, the new certificate won't be imported and a failure message will be logged in the Server Log.  

> **Note:**
>
> SecureTransport protocol servers and services does not require restart after importing, overwriting, or deleting a trusted certificate.

1.  Select **Setup > Certificates**.
2.  Click the **Trusted CAs** tab.
3.  Click **Import**.
4.  Type an alias for the certificate in the **Alias** box.  
    If you use an alias that is already assigned to another certificate, the imported certificate overwrites the original one. Be sure that you are entering the appropriate alias for the new certificate.
5.  Identify the certificate to import using one of the following methods:
    -   Click **Import certificate from file** and type the file name.
    -   Click **Paste certificate in space below** and paste the certificate text in the box.
6.  Click **Import**.
