}For client-initiated file transfers using the AS2 (SSL), FTPS, HTTPS, PeSIT (SSL, legacy SSL), or SSH (SFTP and SCP) protocols, you can restrict the Axway SecureTransport Server to use only FIPS certified cryptographic libraries. This requires the sender and the recipient (clients and partner servers) to use only approved algorithms, ciphers, and cipher suites and assures that the entire transfer is secure at FIPS 140-2 LevelÂ 1.

For a complete list of supported ciphers and algorithms that be used in FIPS mode, see [Advertised ciphers and cipher suites](r_st_required_ciphers_cipher_suites).
