}The {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} Server and Edge must access disk files and the database on disk for all file transfer and processing actions. If {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} is installed on a network or shared drive, application performance depends on network throughput and processes from other computers accessing the drive.

{{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} installation on a network drive, regardless of its performance characteristics, is not supported. To avoid performance problems, always install {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} on a local disk drive.
