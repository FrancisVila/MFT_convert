}Before considering configuration changes to improve performance, investigate factors that might result in reduced performance. Consider the following factors:

-   How many transfers have occurred during recent typical and peak transfer periods? Has the number of transfers increased from the levels before the performance problems were observed?
-   How many concurrent users or partner sessions are transferring files during recent typical and peak transfer periods? Has the number of user or sessions increased from the levels before the performance problems were observed?
-   Is your organization no longer meeting service level agreements with your customers?

If performance issues are due to increased workload, perhaps increasing slowly over time, evaluate implementing a cluster or adding a server to an existing cluster to accommodate the additional workload.
