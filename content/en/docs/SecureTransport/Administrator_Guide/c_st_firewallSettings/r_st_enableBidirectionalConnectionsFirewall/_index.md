}If you are using FTP for file transfers, you might need to configure your firewall to use bidirectional FTP transfers. Bidirectional FTP data connections might not be enabled in your firewall by default. Bidirectional FTP data connections are not considered as safe since the data connection is interactive and the connection changes the basic way FTP works.

The following topics provide how-to instructions for enabling bidirectional connections:
