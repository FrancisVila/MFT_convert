}The exact list of ports to open depends on which <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">SecureTransport</span> functions you use. For example, if you do not enable FTP connections to your server, then you can disregard the ports listed below for FTP.

The following lists show the ports that <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">SecureTransport</span> can use. The values given are the defaults. You can reconfigure <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">SecureTransport</span> after installation to use different values.
