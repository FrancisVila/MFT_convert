-   Range of address using Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation
-   Range of address using IPv4 address and netmask
-   Patten matching an IPv4 address
-   Exact host name
-   Pattern matching a host name

The following topics IP address and host name syntax usage:

-   [Exact IPv4 or IPv6 address](r_st_exact_ipv4_ipv6_address) - Describes the use of an exact IPv4 or IPv6 address to specify a single server.
-   [Range of address using Classless Inter-Domain Routing notation](r_st_classless_inter-domain_routing_notation) - Describes the use of a range of addresses using classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) notation.
-   [Range of address using IPv4 address and subnet mask](r_st_addresses_using_ipv4_address_subnet_mask) - Describes the use of an IPv4 address and a subnet mask separated by a colon (`:`) to represent a range of IPv4 addresses.
-   [Patten matching an IPv4 address](r_st_patten_matching_ipv4_address) - Describes the use of an IPv4 address pattern to represent a range of IPv4 addresses.
-   [Exact host name](r_st_exact_host_name) - Describes the use of a literal host name to represent a single host where host names are valid.
-   [Pattern matching a host name](r_st_pattern_matching_host_name) - Describes the use of a host name pattern that uses asterisk (`*`) to represent one or more characters and question mark (`?`) to represent one character.
