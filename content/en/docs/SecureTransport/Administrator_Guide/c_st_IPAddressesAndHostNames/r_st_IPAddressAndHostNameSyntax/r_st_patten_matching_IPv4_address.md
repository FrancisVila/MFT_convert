}Use an IPv4 address pattern to represent a range of IPv4 addresses. Use an asterisk (`*`) to match any sequence of octal digits.

Examples of valid values include the following:

-   `172.23.34.*` represents `172.23.34.0` through `172.23.34.255`
-   `172.56.*.*` represents `172.56.0.0` through `172.56.255.255`
