}Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation specifies an IPv4 or IPv6 address and a number of significant bits separated by a slash (`/`). In other contexts, CIDR notation is used to specify an IP address and a subnet. For SecureTransport, use CIDR notation to represent a range of IP addresses.

Examples of valid values include the following:

-   `172.23.34.0/24` represents `172.23.34.0` through `172.23.34.255`
-   `FC00:1234:56::/120` represents `FC00:1234:56::` through `FC00:1234:56::FF`
