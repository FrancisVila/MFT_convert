}You can use an already created account as a template to create additional accounts with the same settings. Some information in each account must be unique to that account such as the account name, the home folder and so on. Items that must be unique have an asterisk by the field name. When you select **Duplicate Account** you are guided through the different pages where you can alter the user information, the transfer site and subscription details, and the accounts.

1.  Open the user or service account you want to use as a template. On the Settings tab, click **Duplicate Account**.  
    A *New Service Account* or *New User Account* page is displayed with a **Next** button at the bottom of the page.
2.  Change the account name, home folder and any other user information you want to modify, such as the password. Click **Next** to continue  
    If the account you are using as a template has a transfer site set up, the *Add Transfer Site* page is displayed.
3.  Add a new transfer site, modify the existing settings, or click **Next** to continue without making any changes.  
    If you did not add a transfer site, the *Subscriptions* page is displayed. Continue with step 5.  
    If you added a transfer site, the *Transfer Profiles* page is displayed.
4.  Add a new transfer profile, modify the existing settings, or click **Next** to continue without making any changes.  
    The *Subscriptions* page is displayed.
5.  Modify the subscription settings and click **Next** to continue.  
    The new account is saved to the server and displayed on the *Settings* tab of the user account. The new account is disabled. Routes assigned to the duplicated account are also copied to the new account. If subscriptions are changed during duplication and they had routes assigned, the copied routes are assigned to respective changed subscriptions.

> **Note:**
>
> You will not be able to change the value in the Route drop-down menu while duplicating an account. You can the Route value afterwards via the Subscriptions tab in the newly created user account.
