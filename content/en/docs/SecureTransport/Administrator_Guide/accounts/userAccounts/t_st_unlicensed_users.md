}The recipient of an ad hoc human-to-human file transfer email or a system-to-human file transfer email does not need all SecureTransport user account functionality to retrieve the files. If the recipient does not need other SecureTransport functionality, the recipient can be an unlicensed user. As the name implies, unlicensed users do not require an account license to connect to SecureTransport to retrieve or reply to messages.

Unlicensed users can log in to SecureTransport using ST Web Client or one of the Axway Email Plug-ins to retrieve files. Using ST Web Client, they can reply once to the sender of a file transfer email. Using Microsoft Outlook or Lotus Notes, they can reply to a file transfer email as they would to any email. They cannot create or forward messages with ad hoc file transfers. For an unlicensed user, ST Web Client does not include the file transfer functions.

If the ad hoc human-to-human file transfer specifies enrollment as an unlicensed user or the System to Human transfer site specifies a security level of `Enroll User - Unlicensed`, the recipient becomes an unlicensed user on enrollment.

Create account templates for unlicensed users. Configure the account template that applies to unlicensed users in the business unit or in the **Default enrollment account template** field on the *AdHoc Setting* page. See [Manage account templates](../../../c_st_advancedaccountadministration/c_st_accounttemplates/t_st_accounttemplates), [Create or edit a business unit](t_st_businessunits.htm#create), and [Configure adhoc file transfers](../../../c_st_setup/t_st_adhocconfiguration).

You can also create an unlicensed user account from the *Unlicensed User Accounts* page.

2.  Click **New Account**.
