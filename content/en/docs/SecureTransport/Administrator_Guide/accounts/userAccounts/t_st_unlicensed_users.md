}The recipient of an ad hoc human-to-human file transfer email or a system-to-human file transfer email does not need all {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} user account functionality to retrieve the files. If the recipient does not need other {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} functionality, the recipient can be an unlicensed user. As the name implies, unlicensed users do not require an account license to connect to {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} to retrieve or reply to messages.

Unlicensed users can log in to {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} using ST Web Client or one of the {{< SecureTransport/companyname  >}} Email Plug-ins to retrieve files. Using ST Web Client, they can reply once to the sender of a file transfer email. Using Microsoft Outlook or Lotus Notes, they can reply to a file transfer email as they would to any email. They cannot create or forward messages with ad hoc file transfers. For an unlicensed user, ST Web Client does not include the file transfer functions.

If the ad hoc human-to-human file transfer specifies enrollment as an unlicensed user or the System to Human transfer site specifies a security level of `Enroll User - Unlicensed`, the recipient becomes an unlicensed user on enrollment.

Create account templates for unlicensed users. Configure the account template that applies to unlicensed users in the business unit or in the **Default enrollment account template** field on the *AdHoc Setting* page. See <a href="../../../c_st_advancedaccountadministration/c_st_accounttemplates/t_st_accounttemplates#top" class="MCXref xref">Manage account templates</a>, <a href="#Create" class="MCXref xref">Create or edit a business unit</a>, and <a href="../../../c_st_setup/t_st_adhocconfiguration#SetupMenu_1217491348_1052091" class="MCXref xref">Configure adhoc file transfers</a>.
