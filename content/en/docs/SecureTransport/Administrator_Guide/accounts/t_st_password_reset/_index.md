}The SecureTransport Web Client users can reset their passwords if allowed by the administrator. If users have an email address configured in their SecureTransport account, they can reset their passwords from the *Login* page. If not, they must contact the SecureTransportadministrator to reset the password.

To reset a password, an end user must click on the **Forgot your password?** link on the SecureTransport Web Client login page and the following window will be displayed:

A valid and unique email address must be provided.

Client password reset will not work if emails assigned to user accounts in SecureTransport are not unique.

SecureTransport sends an email with password reset instructions to the email address provided.

Once the user opens the link in the email, they are prompted to enter and confirm the new password in the displayed form.

If secret question service is enabled, the user must provide an answer to a secret question as part of the password reset process.

The user must fill in all the fields, save, and in case of success, log in with the new password.

#### Token

A token will be generated for authentication during the whole password reset process.

The token is encrypted with the SecureTransport Secret and bears its creation-time stamp and the account's email.

A token is expired if time, indicated by the `PasswordReset.LinkExpirationInterval` configuration option, has passed or if a password reset has occurred after the creation of the token.

The link sent via email will have the following structure: `https://<st_ip>/passwordReset?token=<encryptedString>`.

If the secret question feature is enabled in SecureTransport, the users must answer a secret question, which they have preciously set, before they can reset their password.
