## Folder Monitor specifics

The Folder Monitor protocol differs from the other supported protocols in the following aspects:

-   The folders listed in `<FILEDRIVEHOME>/conf/unsafe.paths.conf` file (and their sub-folders) cannot be specified in the **Upload Folder** and **Download Folder** fields.
-   The paths, specified in the **Upload Folder** and **Download Folder** fields, must be full system paths (not relative paths), such as:  
    `/tmp/folder_name/opt/TMWD/folder_name/`  
-   The files uploaded/moved into the specified upload folder are owned by the root user of the system.
-   If <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">SecureTransport</span> is installed as a non-root deployment, the files in upload folder are owned by the user running the <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">SecureTransport</span> Server.
-   If you configure the account to impersonate a user, the impersonated user must have full rights to the directories specified in the Folder Monitor.
-   If you upload or move a file in the specified upload folder and such a file already exists there, it is overwritten without a prompt.
-   If <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">SecureTransport</span> is installed as a non-root deployment, the user running the <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">SecureTransport</span> Server must have the necessary permissions to overwrite the file.
-   When the Folder Monitor starts to monitor the download folder, the download pattern is applied to all the files in the folder, even if they existed in the download folder before the Folder Monitor began monitoring.
-   If <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">SecureTransport</span> is installed as a non-root deployment, the user running the <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">SecureTransport</span> Server must have the necessary permissions to write to the upload folder.
-   <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">SecureTransport</span> does not support placing the download folder and the upload folder under a repository encryption user home folder.
-   If you create a service account and a Standard Router application that uses a Folder Monitor transfer site, and you specify the same directory for sending and receiving messages, file transfers fail.
-   A Folder Monitor transfer site can be used to receive messages for only one subscription.
-   The names of the download folder and the upload folder of a Folder Monitor transfer site cannot contain two or more of the following characters in a sequence: `( ) _ - + = { } ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & ; â â â â`. For example, `folder_name` is supported, but `folder_+name` is not supported.
-   The name of a file processed by a Folder Monitor transfer site cannot contain two more of the following characters in sequence: `< > | : ? " * / \ % [ ] ~` (at the beginning of the file only).
-   Two Folder Monitor transfer sites cannot have the same download folder and download pattern.
-   The Folder Monitor service runs on the primary server in a Standard Cluster (SC). If that server fails, the Folder Monitor service automatically fails over to the new primary server.
-   The Folder Monitor service runs on one server in an Enterprise Cluster (EC). If that server fails, the Folder Monitor service automatically fails over to the server in the cluster with the Transaction Manager that has been running the longest.
