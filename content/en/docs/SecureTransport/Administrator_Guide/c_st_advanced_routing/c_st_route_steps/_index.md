}This topic includes detailed configuration information for the route steps. Detailed configuration information is provided for the Publish To Account and Send To Partner route steps.

> The purpose of routing steps is to move successfully transformed files out of the sandbox folder. It is highly recommended that each route terminates with at least one routing step (either Publish To Account or Send To Partner), otherwise the transformed file will not reach its destination and will be deleted when the route execution finishes.

The following topics provide detailed route step configuration information:

-   [Publish To Account](t_st_publish_to_account) - Provides detailed how-to information for configuring a Publish To Account route step.
-   [Send To Partner](t_st_send_to_partner) - Provides detailed how-to information for configuring a Send To Partner route step.
