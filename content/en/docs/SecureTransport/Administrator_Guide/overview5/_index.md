}SecureTransport is part of the Axway family of managed file transfer (MFT) products. SecureTransport allows organizations to adeptly control and manage the transfer of files inside and outside of the corporate firewall in support of mission-critical business processes and ad hoc human transactions, while satisfying policy and regulatory compliance requirements. SecureTransport serves as a hub and router for moving files between humans, systems, and more. SecureTransport also completes tasks related to moving files (push or pull), hosting files in mailboxes or "FTP-like" folders, and provides portal access with configurable workflow for file handling and routing. SecureTransport delivers user-friendly governance and configuration capabilities, including delegated administration and pre-defined and configurable workflows, while providing the highest possible level of security.
