}On UNIX-based systems, you can define entries in the *User Type Ranges* page that SecureTransport uses to set the user type for an LDAP user when the user type is not set by the other actions listed in [LDAP logins](../c_st_ldap_logins). You specify a range of values for the user ID (UID) and the user type for SecureTransport to assign to users with values in that range. Every LDAP user on a UNIX-based system has a user ID. See [LDAP logins](../c_st_ldap_logins) for the actions that set the user ID.
