}One of the first things to determine is if a problem is in the SiteMinder configuration settings. The following SiteMinder tools are helpful in troubleshooting the SiteMinder configuration:

-   **SiteMinder Test Tool** – helpful in testing agent, rule, and policy configurations in SiteMinder.
-   **SiteMinder Debug Log files** – helpful in troubleshooting SiteMinder Policy Server configuration issues. These debug log files are configured using the Netegrity Policy Server Management Console.

Refer to the SiteMinder documentation for information about these tools.
