}Web clients can log in to SecureTransport directly or through the SiteMinder Single Sign-On (SSO) portal. Depending on the SiteMinder configuration, when a web client logs in, SecureTransport can require a client certificate, which it presents to SiteMinder for authentication.

When a web client logs on through the SiteMinder SSO portal, the portal authenticates the user and provides the client with a SiteMinder session cookie. When the client tries to access a SecureTransport resource, SecureTransport presents the userâ€™s session cookie to SiteMinder for authentication.
