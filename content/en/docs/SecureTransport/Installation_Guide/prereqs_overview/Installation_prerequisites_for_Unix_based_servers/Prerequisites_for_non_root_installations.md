}If you are installing <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">SecureTransport</span> for a non-root execution, consider the following information before starting the installer:

-   The installation process should be started with the non-root user, defined in the `/etc/passwd` file and have a valid shell that allows login and command execution. For example, `/sbin/nologin` is not a valid shell, but `/bin/bash` is a valid shell.
-   Ðœake sure that the non-root user has a created home folder with the proper permissions:
    -   useradd stuser
    -   mkdir /home/stuser (default)
    -   chown -R stuser: /home/stuser

<!-- -->

-   Increase the resources available to the shell of the non-root user:
    -   open files
    -   max user process

      
    You can check the values of these limits by using `ulimit -a`. Set them to minimum **65536** or higher.

<!-- -->

-   The <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">SecureTransport</span> installation routine calls crontab to set up some entries for log rotation and process monitoring. To tell the installer to skip the calls to crontab:  
    `export INSTALL_CRON=false`
