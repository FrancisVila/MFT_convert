}Axway provides support for Axway SecureTransport running in a virtual environment in an identical manner as with Axway SecureTransport running on any other supported x86-based systems without initially requiring the reproduction of issues on native hardware. If Axway suspects that the virtualization layer is the root cause of an incident, then the customer is required to contact the appropriate virtualization support provider to resolve the virtualization issue.

While Axway SecureTransport is expected to function properly in a virtual environment, there may be performance implications which can invalidate typical sizing and recommendations for Axway SecureTransport.

A virtual environment must provide the minimum required virtual hardware. For details, see [Minimum UNIX hardware requirements](minimum_hardware_requirements.htm#beforeinstallst_3365039947_1090353).
