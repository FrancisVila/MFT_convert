}<span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Company_Name variable">Axway</span> provides support for <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Long_Name variable">Axway SecureTransport</span> running in a virtual environment in an identical manner as with <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Long_Name variable">Axway SecureTransport</span> running on any other supported x86-based systems without initially requiring the reproduction of issues on native hardware. If <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Company_Name variable">Axway</span> suspects that the virtualization layer is the root cause of an incident, then the customer is required to contact the appropriate virtualization support provider to resolve the virtualization issue.

While <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Long_Name variable">Axway SecureTransport</span> is expected to function properly in a virtual environment, there may be performance implications which can invalidate typical sizing and recommendations for <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Long_Name variable">Axway SecureTransport</span>.

A virtual environment must provide the minimum required virtual hardware. For details, see <a href="##beforeinstallst_3365039947_1090353" class="MCXref xref">Minimum UNIX hardware requirements</a>.
