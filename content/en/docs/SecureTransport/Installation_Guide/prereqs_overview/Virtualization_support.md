}{{< SecureTransport/companyname  >}} provides support for {{< SecureTransport/componentlongname  >}} running in a virtual environment in an identical manner as with {{< SecureTransport/componentlongname  >}} running on any other supported x86-based systems without initially requiring the reproduction of issues on native hardware. If {{< SecureTransport/companyname  >}} suspects that the virtualization layer is the root cause of an incident, then the customer is required to contact the appropriate virtualization support provider to resolve the virtualization issue.

While {{< SecureTransport/componentlongname  >}} is expected to function properly in a virtual environment, there may be performance implications which can invalidate typical sizing and recommendations for {{< SecureTransport/componentlongname  >}}.

A virtual environment must provide the minimum required virtual hardware. For details, see <a href="#beforeinstallst_3365039947_1090353" class="MCXref xref">Minimum UNIX hardware requirements</a>.
