}The secret file (also called `taeh` file) contains randomly-generated data used by the <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">SecureTransport</span> system for encryption. It must be the same for all <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">SecureTransport</span> Servers or <span class="mc-variable suite_variables.SecureTransportName variable">SecureTransport</span> Edges in a cluster.

The installer creates the secret file (named `taeh`) when you install a stand-alone server or the first <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">SecureTransport</span> Server in a cluster. It is stored in the `<FILEDRIVEHOME>/bin/taeh` directory, where `<FILEDRIVEHOME>` is the directory where <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">SecureTransport</span> is installed.

For the second and subsequent servers of the cluster, you must copy the `taeh` file from the first cluster node before you install <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">SecureTransport</span>. Make sure the name of the secret file does not contain any special characters or spaces. Then you import the secret file during server installation. After you configure the server, you cannot change the `taeh` file. Changing the secret file after the server is configured may corrupt certain encrypted configuration elements (local certificates, passwords, and so forth).

When you install <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">SecureTransport</span> on a second node in a cluster using an appliance, you are prompted for the remote server credentials and location of the secret file. The other server must be an appliance with <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">SecureTransport</span> installed and an OS-level SSHÂ daemon running.
