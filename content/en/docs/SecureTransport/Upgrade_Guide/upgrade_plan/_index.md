## Should I upgrade?

Before you upgrade, determine if upgrading is appropriate for your environment and production requirements:

    -   New features
    -   Fixed issues
    -   Known limitations
-   Evaluate the effort required for this upgrade. You should consider:
    -   Length and impact of product down time
    -   Basic upgrade effort
    -   Specific actions that might be required due to incompatibilities or limitations. See <a href="incompatibilities" class="MCXref xref">Upgrade paths and incompatibilities</a>.
    -   Initial validation and non-regression testing
    -   Upgrading your different operating environments, for example, test, and preproduction

## Minimum version requirement

## Upgrade methods

There is currently one method for upgrading to {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} {{< SecureTransport/componentversion  >}} from an earlier version:
