> **Note:**
>
> The topics described will refer to your existing SecureTransport 5.5 on Windows Server 2012 R2 deployment as the original deployment. Your future SecureTransport 5.5 (on either Windows Server 2016 or Windows Server 2019) deployment is referred to as the new deployment.

Instructions in these topics pertain to {{< SecureTransport/securetransportname  >}} {{< SecureTransport/componentversion  >}} only. If you are using a previous version of {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}}, follow the upgrade procedures as provided in this guide.

In the listed topics, to avoid confusion, the following terminology is introduced:

-   The current {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname >}} deployment on Windows Server 2012 R2 is also referred to as the *original* deployment.
-   Similarly, your future deployment (Windows Server 2016 or Windows Server 2019) is also referred to as the *new* deployment.
