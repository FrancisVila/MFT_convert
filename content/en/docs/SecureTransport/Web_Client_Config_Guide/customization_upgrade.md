}Most customizations (feature toggles, localization, branding texts, and view configuration) do not have to be recreated after patching or upgrading {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}}. The exceptions are the icon and the color theme. To replace the icon, see [Change the favicon](../webclient_branding#Change2). To recreate the color theme, see [Change the color theme and/or the style](../webclient_branding#Change).

If {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} is uninstalled, the `custom` folder will be removed. Before uninstalling SecureTransport, back up the `custom` folder. The backed up `custom` folder can be used in future {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} installations.
