}Most customizations (feature toggles, localization, branding texts, and view configuration) do not have to be recreated after patching or upgrading {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}}. The exceptions are the icon and the color theme. To replace the icon, see <a href="../webclient_branding#Change2" class="MCXref xref">Change the favicon</a>. To recreate the color theme, see <a href="../webclient_branding#Change" class="MCXref xref">Change the color theme and/or the style</a>.

If {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} is uninstalled, the `custom` folder will be removed. Before uninstalling SecureTransport, back up the `custom` folder. The backed up `custom` folder can be used in future {{< SecureTransport/componentshortname  >}} installations.
