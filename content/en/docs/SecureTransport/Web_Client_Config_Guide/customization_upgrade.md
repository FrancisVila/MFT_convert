}Most customizations (feature toggles, localization, branding texts, and view configuration) do not have to be recreated after patching or upgrading SecureTransport. The exceptions are the icon and the color theme. To replace the icon, see [Change the favicon](../webclient_branding). To recreate the color theme, see [Change the color theme and/or the style](../webclient_branding).

If SecureTransport is uninstalled, the `custom` folder will be removed. Before uninstalling SecureTransport, back up the `custom` folder. The backed up `custom` folder can be used in future SecureTransport installations.
