}A transfer site is a location such as a local folder or a protocol server used when sending or receiving files during a server-initiated transfer or for handling files arriving over AS2. Transfer sites are specified and managed on a per-account basis.

When defining a transfer site as part of an account, you need to provide the information required for connecting to the site, authenticating (when applicable) and sending and/or receiving files. The selected transfer protocol dictates what information is required to define the transfer site. The protocol of an existing transfer site cannot be changed.

In general, a site is used for AS2 transfers or server-initiated transfers. In the case of a server-initiated transfer, a file is either uploaded to the site when a subscription processes an uploaded file or downloaded from the site using a scheduler in a subscription.
