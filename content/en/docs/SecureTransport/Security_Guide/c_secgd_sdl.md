}<span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Company_Name variable">Axway</span> implements a Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) in product development. A dedicated <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Company_Name variable">Axway</span> team, the Software Security Group (SSG), manages the SSDLC in association with all the Research and Development (R&D) product teams.

The SSDLC consists of a set of standard phases and processes. In this spiral development model, requirements and design are frequently revisited to ensure that risks are assessed and eliminated. The following diagram illustrates the simplified Microsoft SSDLC model that Axway follows.

<span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Company_Name variable">Axway</span> development teams follow Agile practices and implement SSDLC processes and controls throughout the development lifecycle. For example, threat-modeling is an important part of the design phase and a final security review is required before product release. These processes and control points ensure that products meet the initial security requirements and pass the technical criteria established by SSG and the larger security community.

Development teams use a broad suite of industry-standard tools in the implementation and verification phases of the SDL. Teams run both static and dynamic analysis tools to identify potential code weaknesses and to discover security issues that could be exposed at run-time. The R&D Teams also run suites of attack surface tools and penetration testing tools on products to ensure that they meet gating criteria defined by SSG via the SSDLC. Teams also run other enhanced test scenarios required by our most security-conscious customers. <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Company_Name variable">Axway</span> provides tool suite information and our customized usage profiles on request.

<span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Company_Name variable">Axway</span>â€™s new product introduction (NPI) process supports the release of new products and major product revisions. This process requires a final security review that includes development and test artifacts. The NPI also ensures that the SSDLC is started early in development to optimize the delivery of secured products for you, our customer.
