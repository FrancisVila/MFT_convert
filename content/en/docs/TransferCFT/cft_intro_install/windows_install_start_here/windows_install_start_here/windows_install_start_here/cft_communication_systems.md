}This topic presents basic information
about the hardware devices and the software for each of the communications
systems. Direct contact
with the distributor ensures that you have an exhaustive and accurate
list of devices than can be used with Transfer CFT Windows.

Transfer CFT Windows uses the TCP/IP network as its communications
system.

Transfer CFT provides two options:

-   EICON option
-   CAPI option

EICON option

This option was validated with the EICON card resident on the
same machine on which Transfer CFT Windows executes.

On Windows, EICON products used for validation were:

-   -   C21 card or
        a S51 card
    -   EICON WAN services
        for Windows (V3R4)
    -   Eicon WAN Adapters

Refer to the operations to perform prior to your first
start-up with an EICON card, in [Running CFT for the first time](../running_cft_for_the_first_time_windows).

CAPI option

This option works with all types of cards. It has been validated with
a CAPI interface card resident on the same machine on which Transfer CFT Windows
is executed, under all operating systems.

The products used for validation are:

-   DIVA card from
    EICON, or GAZEL card
-   Corresponding CAPI
    driver

Refer to the operations to perform prior to your first
start-up with ISDN-CAPI cards, in [Running CFT for the first time](../running_cft_for_the_first_time_windows).

### <span id="TCP_IP_network"></span>TCP/IP network

Transfer CFT can be based on the TCP/IP layer supplied as standard by
Windows.

When it operates in TCP/IP, Transfer CFT can use any type of link that
can be implemented via the WINSOCK interface.

Refer to the operations to perform prior to your first
start-up in TCP/IP, in [Running CFT for the first time](../running_cft_for_the_first_time_windows).
