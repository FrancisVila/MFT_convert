### Installation overview

This table presents a high-level overview of the installation process. By default, the <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Long_Name variable">Transfer CFT</span> installation uses a delivered configuration file called <span class="code">initialize.properties</span> that provides a series of default values to simplify installation. It is important that you understand the difference between customizing this file before or after running the installer prior to starting the process.

### Installation restrictions for multi-node

The following multi-node restrictions apply:

-   Bandwidth control is calculated by node.
-   Accounting statistics are generated by node.
-   Nodes are not automatically re-balanced when a host is recovered after a failure.
-   Duplicate file detection is not supported.
-   When using COMS, the SEND/RECV commands does not support STATE=HOLD with WSTATE.
-   You cannot have more than one defined CFTCOM TYPE=FILE object.

When using <span class="mc-variable Primary.CG or_UM variable">Central Governance</span> with <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">Transfer CFT</span> multi node, you cannot manage <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">Transfer CFT</span> updates. You are required to manually update the nodes.

### Install functions

You can perform the following installation functions:

-   Install
-   Upgrade
-   Update
-   Uninstall

### Installation configuration file

The <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Long_Name variable">Transfer CFT</span> installation is based on a delivered configuration file called <span class="code">initialize.properties</span> that provides a series of default values to simplify installation. You can make a copy of this file and customize it prior to running the installation procedure as described in [Customize the initialize.properties file](properties_file_win).

### Installation modes

The following installation modes use the delivered initialize.properties file as the default configuration file. In graphical mode you can install, but not operate, <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Long_Name variable">Transfer CFT</span> without customizing certain mandatory values in this file. To run silent mode, you must at least define an installation directory prior to running the unattended installation.

Graphical mode

Transfer\_CFT\_3.6\_Install\_win-x86-64\_BNXXXXXXXX.exe

Silent

start /W Transfer\_CFT\_3.6\_Install\_win-x86-64\_BNXXXXXXXX.exe --mode unattended --conf-file configuration.template

### Create or modify the runtime

You can use the following command to repair the runtime if there was an issue during the installation, or to update values that you have modified in the <span class="code">initialize.properties</span> file. From the &lt;installation\_directory>, run the following:

&lt;installation directory> initialize filename

You cannot configure the Windows services using the initialize.exe command. Please see [Install services in command line](../install_services_command_line) to manually configure the Windows services.

### Using symbolic links

If you want to use symbolic links, the link path must use a slash delimiter as shown in the following example:

-   Correct:` S:\>mklink /j F:\CFT36m5 F:\CFT36_BN12786077_5`
-   Incorrect:` S:\>mklink /j F:CFT36m5 F:CFT36_BN12786077_5`

To install Transfer CFT using symbolic links, you must use the silent mode, <span class="code">option '--mode unattended'</span>, and assign all parameters using only the configuration file (do not use parameters in the command line except the conf-file).

   <tbody>
      <tr>
         <td>         </td>
         <td><span><strong>Note</strong></span>         </td>
         <td>If an installation that uses symbolic links fails, once you have corrected the silent files, you must delete the <span class="mc-variable suite_variables.TransferCFTName variable">Transfer CFT</span> home installation directory, to which the symbolic link points, prior to retrying the installation.         </td>
      </tr>
   </tbody>

The user who installs Transfer CFT must be an administrator on the system where you are performing the installation.
