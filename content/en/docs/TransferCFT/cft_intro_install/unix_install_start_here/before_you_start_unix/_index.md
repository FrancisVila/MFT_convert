}## Before you start

If you are installing Transfer CFT as part of a managed file transfer solution, you may want to check the installation order and prerequisites. For more information, please refer to the Central Governance documentation.

If you want to enable Central Governance during installation, please check that your license includes Central Governance and that you have the required information, such as the shared secret, to activate connectivity.

### Installation overview

This table presents a high-level overview of the installation process. By default, the Transfer CFT installation uses a delivered configuration file called initialize.properties that provides a series of default values to simplify installation. It is important that you understand the difference between customizing this file before or after running the installer prior to starting the process.

### Installation restrictions for multi-node

The following multi-node restrictions apply:

-   Bandwidth control is calculated by node.
-   Accounting statistics are generated by node.
-   Nodes are not automatically re-balanced when a host is recovered after a failure.
-   Duplicate file detection is not supported.
-   When using COMS, the SEND/RECV commands do not support STATE=HOLD with WSTATE.
-   You cannot have more than one defined CFTCOM TYPE=FILE object.

When using Central Governance with Transfer CFT multi node, you cannot manage Transfer CFT updates. You are required to manually update the nodes.

### Installation functions

You can perform the following installation functions:

-   Install
-   Upgrade
-   Update
-   Uninstall

### Check the "noexec" mount option before installing

Before running the InstallBuilder, ensure that the /tmp directory and the user's homedir do not have the "noexec" option on that mount point. See [Troubleshooting the installation](../troubleshoot_registration) for workarounds.

### Installation configuration file

The Transfer CFT installation is based on a delivered configuration file called initialize.properties that provides as series of default values to simplify installation. As described in [Customize the initialize.properties file](new_install_ux), you can make a copy of this file and customize it prior to running the installation procedure.

### Installation modes

The following installation modes use the delivered initialize.properties file as the default configuration file. In graphical or text mode you can install, but not operate, Transfer CFT without customizing certain mandatory values in this file. In silent mode, you must at least define an installation directory prior to running the unattended installation.

Graphical (console) mode

./Transfer\_CFT\_3.9\_Install\_&lt;OS>\_&lt;BN>.run

Interactive (text) mode

./Transfer\_CFT\_3.9\_Install\_&lt;OS>\_&lt;BN>.run --mode text

Silent mode (unattended)

./Transfer\_CFT\_3.9\_Install\_&lt;OS>\_&lt;BN>.run --mode unattended --conf-file initialize.properties

### Create or modify the runtime

You can use the following command to repair the runtime if there was an issue during the installation, or to update values that you have modified in the initialize.properties file. From the &lt;installation\_directory>, run the following:

&lt;installation directory> ./initialize filename

### Using symbolic links

To install Transfer CFT using symbolic links, you must use the silent mode, option '--mode unattended', and assign all parameters using only the configuration file (do not use parameters in the command line except the conf-file).
