}This topic describes the <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">Transfer CFT</span> to <span class="mc-variable Primary.CG or_UM variable">Central Governance</span> or <span class="mc-variable suite_variables.FlowManager variable">Flow Manager</span> registration process.

There are several types of exchanges that occur between <span class="mc-variable Primary.CG or_UM variable">Central Governance</span> or <span class="mc-variable suite_variables.FlowManager variable">Flow Manager</span> and <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">Transfer CFT</span>. The first exchange is registration, which begins when Copilot initiates a request to connect with <span class="mc-variable Primary.CG or_UM variable">Central Governance</span> or <span class="mc-variable suite_variables.FlowManager variable">Flow Manager</span>.

The registration is performed on a SSL connection using simple authentication. Further exchanges - the heartbeat, and certificate renewal - are performed on a SSL connection using mutual authentication.

Refer to the <span class="mc-variable Primary.CG or_UM variable">Central Governance</span> <span class="mc-variable Primary.CG_version variable">1.1.3</span> User Guide for more information on registration processes, such as registration approval.

## Step overview

This section describes the general steps that occurs during the registration process, and the impact on the configuration.

Starting Copilot after installation begins the connection and registration process with <span class="mc-variable Primary.CG or_UM variable">Central Governance</span> or <span class="mc-variable suite_variables.FlowManager variable">Flow Manager</span>.

<table>
   <tbody>
      <tr>
         <td>         </td>
         <td><span><strong>Note</strong></span>         </td>
         <td>Transfer CFT requires the Central Governance or <span class="mc-variable suite_variables.FlowManager variable">Flow Manager</span> shared secret to register. See the Central Governance or <span class="mc-variable suite_variables.FlowManager variable">Flow Manager</span> documentation for details.         </td>
      </tr>
   </tbody>
</table>

1\. Copilot connects to Central Governance or <span class="mc-variable suite_variables.FlowManager variable">Flow Manager</span> and submits its registration.

-   Copilot sends a registration request through a simple authenticated SSL connection and submits its registration. Copilot authenticates the Central Governance or <span class="mc-variable suite_variables.FlowManager variable">Flow Manager</span> server using the CA certificate pointing by the uconf:cg.ca\_cert\_id parameter. The registration request contains:
    -   Information about the <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">Transfer CFT</span> instance, including its instance name, host, port and version.
    -   Two Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) for <span class="mc-variable Primary.CG or_UM variable">Central Governance</span> to process.

    <table>
       <tbody>
          <tr>
             <td>         </td>
             <td><span><strong>Note</strong></span>         </td>
             <td>If you use an intermediate certificate as a governance CAÂ certificate, you must add the root CA certificate that signs this intermediate certificate in the Transfer CFT PKI database.         </td>
          </tr>
       </tbody>
    </table>

2\. <span class="mc-variable Primary.CG or_UM variable">Central Governance</span> or <span class="mc-variable suite_variables.FlowManager variable">Flow Manager</span> sends the SSL certificates to <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">Transfer CFT</span>.

Central Governance or <span class="mc-variable suite_variables.FlowManager variable">Flow Manager</span> processes the CSRs and returns two SSL certificates, one dedicated to governance exchanges and the other one dedicated to business exchanges (used for securing file transfers between the registering <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">Transfer CFT</span> and all other <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Solution_Short_Name variable">Managed File Transfer</span>s).

Both certificates are stored in the internal PKI base using the following identifiers:

-   &lt;uconf:cft.instance\_id>\_GOV for the governance certificate
-   &lt;uconf:cft.instance\_id> for the business certificate

3\. Copilot sends the first heartbeat over a mutual authenticated SSL connection.

4\. The Transfer CFT configuration is updated and returned to Transfer CFT.

During the registration process <span class="mc-variable Primary.CG or_UM variable">Central Governance</span> or <span class="mc-variable suite_variables.FlowManager variable">Flow Manager</span> receives the current configuration of <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">Transfer CFT</span> and changes it accordingly to their own rules.

Registration completes with Transfer CFT appearing in the <span class="mc-variable Primary.CG or_UM variable">Central Governance</span> or <span class="mc-variable suite_variables.FlowManager variable">Flow Manager</span> product list with the status of "Started" or "Stopped".

## Configuration updates

During the registration process Central Governance or <span class="mc-variable suite_variables.FlowManager variable">Flow Manager</span> receives the original Transfer CFT configuration and updates it so that Transfer CFT is configured to:

-   Connect to <span class="mc-variable Primary.CG or_UM variable">Central Governance</span> using the Central Governance mutual authentication port
-   Use Central Governance for access management
-   Use Central Governance for transfer monitoring
-   Use its own internal PKI

These changes create two security profiles (CFTSSL) for Transfer CFT, one client and one server, named SSL\_DEFAULT.

Completing the registration process, <span class="mc-variable Primary.CG or_UM variable">Central Governance</span> or <span class="mc-variable suite_variables.FlowManager variable">Flow Manager</span> gets the current configuration of <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">Transfer CFT</span> and changes it.

-   <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">Transfer CFT</span> is configured to use the <span class="mc-variable Primary.CG or_UM variable">Central Governance</span> <span class="mc-variable suite_variables.PassPortName variable">PassPort</span> service for access management.
-   <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">Transfer CFT</span> is configured to use the <span class="mc-variable Primary.CG or_UM variable">Central Governance</span> <span class="mc-variable Primary.Sentinel variable">Sentinel</span> for transfer monitoring. For Transfer CFT 3.2.2 and higher, a secured connection is used.

These changes create two security profiles (CFTSSL) on the <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">Transfer CFT</span> (except when using a SAF-based PKI <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">Transfer CFT</span>). The profiles are named SSL\_DEFAULT; one profile is of type client and one is of type server. Their SSL version is TLSV1COMP. The configured cipher list is CIPHLIST= ('53','47') for <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">Transfer CFT</span> 3.1.2 and 3.1.3. The values represent the following cipher suites:

The values represent the following cipher suites:

-   47: TLS\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_128\_CBC\_SHA
-   53: TLS\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_256\_CBC\_SHA

For Transfer CFT 3.2.2 and higher, the configured cipher list is CIPHLIST= ('49200', '49199', '49192', '49191', '157', '156', '61', '60', '53', '47'). The values represent the following cipher suites:

-   49200: TLS\_ECDHE\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_256\_GCM\_SHA384
-   49199: TLS\_ECDHE\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_128\_GCM\_SHA256
-   49192: TLS\_ECDHE\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_256\_CBC\_SHA384
-   49191: TLS\_ECDHE\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_128\_CBC\_SHA256
-   157: TLS\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_256\_GCM\_SHA384
-   156: TLS\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_128\_GCM\_SHA256
-   61: TLS\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_256\_CBC\_SHA256
-   60: TLS\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_128\_CBC\_SHA256
-   53: TLS\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_256\_CBC\_SHA
-   47: TLS\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_128\_CBC\_SHA

The client and server security profiles must be mutually authenticated. However, by default, a registered <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">Transfer CFT</span> does not have a protocol with a security profile. You must edit the <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">Transfer CFT</span> configuration to support protocols with mutual authentication.

<span class="mc-variable Primary.CG or_UM variable">Central Governance</span> or <span class="mc-variable suite_variables.FlowManager variable">Flow Manager</span> sends the updated configuration to <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">Transfer CFT</span>. The following are the <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">Transfer CFT</span> parameters updated in this process. However, you can overwrite certain default values by assigning an existing policy at registration. Please see, below for details.

### <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">Transfer CFT</span> instance id

When you register <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">Transfer CFT</span> with <span class="mc-variable suite_variables.Central_GovernanceName variable">Central Governance</span> or <span class="mc-variable suite_variables.FlowManager variable">Flow Manager</span>, <span class="mc-variable suite_variables.Central_GovernanceName variable">Central Governance</span> or <span class="mc-variable suite_variables.FlowManager variable">Flow Manager</span> sets the CFTPARM PARTÂ parameter to the same value as the <span class="mc-variable suite_variables.TransferCFTName variable">Transfer CFT</span> installation instance ID. Having a different value may impact transfer monitoring.

### Network definitions

Windows and Linux

For Transfer CFTÂ to register successfully with Flow Manager, it must have at least one of the following Flow Manager network types defined, but cannot have more than one of each type: TCP, pTCP, and UDT. This means that you can register a Transfer CFT that has a maximum of three CFTNET objects, where the Transfer CFTÂ type=TCPÂ and CLASS is different for each CFTNET.

The CFTNETÂ objects are:

-   One pTCP, where ID = &lt;pTCP\_ID> and CLASS=&lt;X> and the UCONF parameter acceleration.ptcp = &lt;pTCP\_ID>
-   One Â UDT, where ID = &lt;UDT\_ID> and CLASS=&lt;Y> and the UCONF parameter acceleration.udt = &lt;UDT\_ID>
-   One TCP, where ID=&lt;TCP\_ID> and CLASS=&lt;Z>

Flow Manager does not manage additional CFTNET types; these are stored, without modification, on the Transfer CFT as retrieved on registration.

### Communication profiles

If the Transfer CFTÂ that is registering has existing network definitions, for example a server type TCP\_SSL definition, Flow Manager creates the appropriate corresponding communication profile on registration.

Flow Manager can create Transfer CFT flows that are configured with the PeSIT E Â protocol. When a Transfer CFT registers with Flow Manager, for each CFTPROT where TYPE=PESIT and PROF=ANY,Â  Flow Manager recognizes communication profiles created with this protocol.
