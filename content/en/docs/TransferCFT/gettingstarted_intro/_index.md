}This *Getting started* section provides a high level overview on how to create basic flows and check the flow status. For more information on using <span class="mc-variable Primary.CG or_UM variable">Central Governance</span>, refer to the <span class="mc-variable Primary.CG or_UM variable">Central Governance</span> User's Guide.

Prior to beginning this section, you installed <span class="mc-variable Primary.CG or_UM variable">Central Governance</span> and your <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">Transfer CFT</span>s, and checked that the <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">Transfer CFT</span>s registration with <span class="mc-variable Primary.CG or_UM variable">Central Governance</span> is complete. Next you can begin setting up your environment for business use.

The following diagram shows the relationship between the activities related to creating a flow. For more information, click the corresponding links below the diagram.

## User interfaces

In this getting started section, you use the following interfaces to configure and then execute your flows.

-   <span class="mc-variable suite_variables.Central_GovernanceName variable">Central Governance</span> UI: This is the UI available after logging on <span class="mc-variable suite_variables.Central_GovernanceName variable">Central Governance</span> that you use to configure flows and monitor Transfer CFT
-   CFTUTIL: Use CFTUTIL, the command line interface for Transfer CFT, to run the transfer commands. The Transfer
    CFT utility is a program which can be activated in batch or interactive
    mode. For information on using CFTUTIL, please refer to [About the CFTUTIL interface](../c_intro_userinterfaces/about_cftutil).

## Syntax and typographical conventions

For each command, CFTUTIL checks the command syntax and enters the command. Refer to *[Typographical
conventions](my_first_transfer_flow_using_cg/typographical_conventions)* for the Transfer CFT command syntax conventions used in this document.
