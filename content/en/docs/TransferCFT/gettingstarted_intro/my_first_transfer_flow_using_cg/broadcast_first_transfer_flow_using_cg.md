}Broadcast and collect modes allow you to send files to multiple partners and receiving files from multiple partners using a single command request for each.

## Broadcast

You can use broadcasting to send a file to an entire group of partners in one command, avoiding the task of sending the selected file individually to each of the partners in a flow.

The name of the broadcast list is itself a virtual partner, which contains a list of partners in your flow. This list of partners can be explicit, or it can reference a file that contains the list of partners.

Additionally, you can define what occurs if a partner is unknown, how the scripts are applied to the broadcast list, and so on. [More information](../../../concepts/transfer_command_overview/broadcast_collect)...

| 4 | Create a file for the flow. | For this example, copy a file SALES_report to transfer in the Store_66 {{< TransferCFT/componentshortname  >}}<code> runtime/pub </code>folder. |   |
| 5 | Execute the SEND command. | From the source {{< TransferCFT/componentshortname  >}}, run the following command:<br/> <code>CFTUTIL SEND PART=DEST_stores, IDF=flow04, FNAME=pub/SALES_report</code> | <a href="../../../c_intro_userinterfaces/about_cftutil">![]($1)</a>  |

## Collect

Collecting files is the inverse of using a broadcast list. In the collect transfer mode you can receive a dedicated file from multiple partners (P*n*). This allows the receiver, or flow initiator, to receive a file from all defined partners using a single request command. More information...
