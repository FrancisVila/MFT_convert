}Adding an application is a prerequisite to defining a flow and being able to exchange files.

1.  Click Applications on the top toolbar to open the Application List page.
2.  Click Add application.
3.  At a minimum:
    -   Enter a unique name for the application.  
    -   Specify the system that hosts the application, a host name or an IP address.
    -   Enter the name of the <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">Transfer CFT</span>.
    -   If <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">Transfer CFT</span> is installed on the same host as the application,Central Governance will detect the matching Transfer CFT instance. You can change this value if you want to associate this application with a different <span class="mc-variable axway_variables.Component_Short_Name variable">Transfer CFT</span>.
4.  Click Save application to add it.

For these exercises repeat the steps and create 3 applications, MainOffice, Store\_66, and Store\_89.
