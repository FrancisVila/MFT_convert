}Click **Flows** on the top toolbar to open the **Flows / Monitoring** page.

The following outlines tasks for defining a flow. Optional steps, such as defining source and target properties, have default values in the user interface and are not described in this getting started topic.

In the **Flow List** page click **Add flow** and perform the following steps:

1.  Select **General information** and complete the fields. The following fields are mandatory (\* denotes mandatory):
    -   Name: Enter a user friendly name, for example **Simple flow**
    -   Identifier: Enter the id that will be used in the transfer commands, for example **flow01** (Transfer CFT IDF)
2.  In the left panel, select **Source** and click **Edit**.  The source is the owner of the data being transferred.
3.  Select **Target** and click **Edit**. The target is the receiver of the exchange.
4.  Optionally, select Protocol and define. You cannot define a protocol until you have defined both the source and target.
5.  Save the flow, or save and deploy the flow.
