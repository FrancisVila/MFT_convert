}When serious faults arise, such as parameter setting errors, overwriting
data, time-outs, and so on, {{< TransferCFT/componentshortname  >}} and the communication
interface generate messages, which are sent to the standard output for your use. For a list of the possible
errors that may occur with a File exit, see [Messages
and error codes](../../../../troubleshoot_intro/messages_and_error_codes_start_here).

You can also generate your own messages and error messages via the fields
indicated in the table below.
