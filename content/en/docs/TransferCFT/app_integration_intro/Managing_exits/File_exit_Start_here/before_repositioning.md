}At the receiver end (DIRECT = R)
with file accessing managed by the user, the user function has to reposition
using the information (rpos, frecs and fcars) the {{< TransferCFT/componentshortname  >}} provides.

At the sender end (DIRECT = S) or
if file accessing is managed by {{< TransferCFT/componentshortname  >}}, the {{< TransferCFT/componentshortname  >}}
has all the information it requires for repositioning.

In both cases, you can request the restart of the transfer Â from
the beginning of the file by setting the ret1 field to 1.
