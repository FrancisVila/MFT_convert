Application Programming Interfaces, or APIs, are a set of functions

that use a service. The service is followed by an application program.



Each of these services is described in one of the following sections, which provides an overview

of the service. Applications can address requests to <span>Transfer CFT</span> via

service call functions:



-   [RESTÂ API](../../apis/api_intro.htm)

-   [Web services](../web_services/about_web_services.htm)

-   [Using JPI](java_api.htm)

-   Transfer

    services

-   Synchronous

    communication services

-   Catalog

    query services



The programming interfaces and programming language are related. The

services can be called by programs in COBOL or in C language as described in this section.



## <span id="About_CFT_Services"></span>About <span>Transfer CFT</span> services



You can query information related to correctly completed transfers.

This information can be accessed in the communication structure.



A description

of this structure sub-assembly is provided in the cftapi.h

for the C language, and cftapi.cop

for COBOL.
