}In order to merge functioning for all platforms, Transfer CFT features
a configuration interface. This interface enables you to easily makes
technical parameter value modifications using either CFTUTIL or the User Interface.

## How to modify UCONF settings

To modify a UCONF value using the graphical user interface:

    icon at the top of the left pane.
2.  In the left pane object manager,
    double click Configuration Parameters.
    The UCONF window is displayed.
3.  Double click the file name
    in the right pane to access the values window for that file. The parameter
    window displays three values or settings.
4.  In the displayed window, you
    can view the current value, modify this value, or return to the default
    value for this file. For a complete listing of the value in previous versions
    of Transfer CFT and the default value, refer to [UCONF
    settings](transfercft/admin_intro/uconf).
5.  Click Ok
    to confirm and close the window.

 Example

In the UCONF window:

    folder.
2.  Select cftcom.
3.  Double click cft.cftcom.default\_size.
    The following diagram illustrates the cft.cftcom.default\_size window.

The top section briefly describes the configuration
setting. Three fields are displayed:

-   Default:
    the preset default value
-   Current:
    this is the actual setting for the parameter and can contain an environmental
    variable
-   Complete:
    this field lists or defines the meaning for the current setting (you can
    think of this as how the system sees or translates the value in the Current field)

1.  Modify the value as required.
    Click Ok to confirm and close
    the window.
