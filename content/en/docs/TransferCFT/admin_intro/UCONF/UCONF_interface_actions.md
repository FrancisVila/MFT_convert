In order to merge functioning for all platforms, Transfer CFT features

a configuration interface. This interface enables you to easily makes

technical parameter value modifications using either CFTUTIL or the User Interface.



This topic describes how to view and modify configuration parameter

values using the User Interface.



## How to modify UCONF settings



To modify a UCONF value using the graphical user interface:



1.  Select the <span>Administration</span>

    icon at the top of the left pane.

2.  In the left pane object manager,

    double click <span>Configuration Parameters</span>.

    The <span>UCONF</span> window is displayed.

3.  Double click the file name

    in the right pane to access the values window for that file. The parameter

    window displays three values or settings.

4.  In the displayed window, you

    can view the current value, modify this value, or return to the default

    value for this file. For a complete listing of the value in previous versions

    of Transfer CFT and the default value, refer to [UCONF

    settings](../uconf/UCONF.htm).

5.  Click <span>Ok</span>

    to confirm and close the window.



 <span>Example</span>



In the <span>UCONF </span>window:



1.  Click to expand the <span>CFT</span>

    folder.

2.  Select <span>cftcom</span>.

3.  Double click <span>cft.cftcom.default\_size</span>.

    The following diagram illustrates the <span>cft.cftcom.default\_size</span> window.



The top section briefly describes the configuration

setting. Three fields are displayed:



-   <span>Default</span>:

    the preset default value

-   <span>Current</span>:

    this is the actual setting for the parameter and can contain an environmental

    variable

-   <span>Complete</span>:

    this field lists or defines the meaning for the current setting (you can

    think of this as how the system sees or translates the value in the <span>Current</span> field)



1.  Modify the value as required.

    Click <span>Ok</span> to confirm and close

    the window.
