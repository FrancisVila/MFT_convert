The

<span>Network resources</span> object corresponds to the CFTNET object in the command line operations.

## <span id="What_is_a_local_network_resource_"></span>What is a local network resource?



The local network resources object:



-   Defines a network

    resource which, for the <span>Transfer CFT</span>, is an entity through which connections

    can be established

-   Supplies the Transfer

    CFT with a number of items of information which are required to access

    the network of the type indicated, TCP/IP and so on, through

    a resource



This object includes:



-   Parameters used

    to manage the <span>Transfer CFT</span> internal facilities: control of connection

    establishing mechanisms for example

-   Parameters describing

    the network environment characteristics defined by the local operating

    system

-   Parameters used

    to establish connections between:

    -   System

        parameters which can make reference to one or more system software components

        (drivers used at card level, and so on)

    -   Transfer

        CFT



When, for a given system or for a given type of network, the environment

description proves to be too complex or too specific, you should group

the corresponding parameters in a separate configuration file (or initialization

program) which is then referenced by the CFTNET object.



Some of the parameters described below are for general use, while others

are only used by a specific system and/or network access method. The parameters

whose meaning is common to all networks are described in the CFTNET -

Generic command paragraph. The specific parameters, grouped by network

type, are then described in the *CFTNET TYPE = xxx <span>topic</span>*.



The TYPE parameter takes the value TCP/IP.



The check for the maximum number of CFTNET objects managed, performed

during the parameter updating phase, may differ in certain environments

from the check performed during <span>Transfer CFT</span> execution. When Transfer

CFT detects an excessive number of CFTNET objects, the following message

appears:Â <span>CFTP16F

CFTNET id for CFTPARM id\_Not loading in memory</span>



## <span id="How_does_the_CFTNET_object_work_"></span>How does the CFTNET object work?



CFTNET is the network local resource declaration. It is used to define

<span>Transfer CFT</span> network resources. CFTNET also supplies the <span>Transfer CFT</span>

with information required to access the required network for the type

indicated.



The CFTNET objects define the network parameters for partners in a given

group. This information includes:



-   Network

    location of the <span>Transfer CFT</span> partner

-   Time slots

    for calls on the network

-   Connection

    retry mechanisms

-   Maximum number

    of connections with each partner



## <span id="Defining_a_network_and_protocol_environment"></span>Defining a network and protocol environment



To define the network and protocol environment, you must create an environment

with the following definitions and links.



These links enable relationships between:



-   The resources

    which can be used by <span>Transfer CFT</span>



Each of these resources is defined by a CFTNET command.

The associated identifier - ID parameter - has the same value as the one

defined for the NET parameters.



A resource is characterized by:



-   Type of

    network accessed

-   The protocols

    which can be used by the PROT

    parameter of the CFTPARM object



Each of these protocols is defined by a CFTPROT object.



A CFTPROT object references a class of resources designated

by an identifier NET parameter.



-   The network

    description used to connect to a given partner



This description is defined in the CFTTCP object,

where TCP indicates

the type of network. The network

and protocol characteristics used to perform a transfer to a given partner.



These characteristics are referenced in the CFTPART

object such that:



-   PROT

    parameter references the CFTPROT used
