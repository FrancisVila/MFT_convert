### <span id="About_the_CFTCAT_object"></span>About the CFTCAT object



The <span>Transfer CFT</span> catalog displays all <span>Transfer CFT</span> transfers in list

form. The catalog file contains control data that is associated with transfers.

A record, that corresponds with a status indicator, exists for each transfer.



Each day the catalog fills with records. The catalog parameters can

be defined to delete records that exceed a certain limit, or to purge

the catalog at a preset time. The catalog purge can be initiated at midnight (default value) or at

a specific time. The catalog is purged in batches of ten entries. Between

each batch, Transfer CFT handles all pending transfer events. As a result,

if the transfer activity is intense, the catalog purge may be extended

but does not disrupt transfers.



Catalog functions include a method to recover information about the

CFT that is using the catalog.



For each <span>PARM</span>, there is one

associated CFTCAT.



### Catalog levels



Catalog levels enable <span>Transfer CFT</span> to issue alerts

when a critical fill threshold, the [TLVWARN](../../CFTUTIL/Parameter_index/tlvwarn.htm)

parameter Threshold Limit Value Warning, for the catalog file is reached.

This alert triggers:



-   Sending

    a message to the LOG and to Sentinel

-   Executing

    a batch to react to the alert (TLVWEXEC parameter)



Once an alert is issued, these two actions are repeated

each time a Catalog event occurs, but not more than once every TLVWRATE

seconds. This alert ends when the fill level drops below the TLVCLEAR

level.
