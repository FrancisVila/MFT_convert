}## How to generate a certificate with XCA

To generate certificates, for example using the XCA utility (X Certificate and Key management), perform the following steps.

1.  Create a **New database**.

    -   Enter a password to protect the database that contains your certificate.

2.  Select the **Certificates** tab.
    -   Select: **New Certificate**

3.  Select the **Source** tab.
    -   In the **Signature algorithm** field, select **MD5**.

4.  Select the **Subject** tab.
    -   Complete the fields for your certificate.

    <!-- -->

    -   Click **Generate a new key**.
        -   Enter a key name
        -   Select 1024 bit as the key size
        -   Select Keytype
        -   Click **Create**

5.  In the **Extensions** tab:

    -   In "Type": select End Entity

    <!-- -->

    -   Select "Subject Key Identifier"

    <!-- -->

    -   Select the expiry date of your certificates

    <!-- -->

    -   Inform: "Subject alternative Name"

6.  In the **Key Usage** tab:
    -   In "Key Usage", select :
        -   Digital Signature

        <!-- -->

        -   Non Repudiation

        <!-- -->

        -   Key Enciphering

        <!-- -->

        -   Data Enciphering

    <!-- -->

    -   In "Extended Key usage", select:
        -   E-mail Protection

7.  Click  **OK** to generate the certificate.

## Export the certificate that has been created.

1.  In **Certificates** tab, select the certificate you want to export.
2.  Select Export.
    -   In Export Format: choose "PEM" for export PUBLIC CERTIFICATE.

    <!-- -->

    -   Click **OK** .

    <!-- -->

    -   Select Export.
3.  Select the certificate you want to export (filename).
    -   In Export Format: choose "PKCS #12" for export PRIVATE CERTIFICATE
    -   Click **OK** .
4.  Enter a password to protect your private certificates.

## How to generate a certificate with OpenSSL

To create a self signed certificate:

Export the certificate in PKCS12 format:

## Use the CFTTF utility to generate your passphrase

Use the CFTTF utility, to perform the following task.

Enter: `CFTTF –pw [XXXX]`

Where: XXXX --> is the same password as your private "PKCS #12" certificates (see above steps).

Example

CFTTF –pw Axway

OUTPUT: m8ZWaOMdkj70UzJZD+wv8gSsi1ycSTEJ5c0H6SH6dLE=

## Update the entity.xml file

In  the delivered entity.xml file, update the location in the user1\_pub entity. For example, if `XPP_Sample_User1.pem` is in the `/home/cft/runtime/conf/tf/certs/pub` folder, then:

In  the delivered entity.xml file, update the location in the user1\_pub entity. For example, if `XPP_Sample_User1.p12` is in the `/home/cft/runtime/conf/tf/certs/priv` folder and the password=Axway, then:

## Update your Trusted File encoding/decoding procedures

You must change the passphrase that corresponds to the private key passphrase generated by CFTTF command ( CFTTF -pw xxxx) in either the `conf/tf/decfile_cms.xml` or `conf/tf/encfile_cms.xml` file.

In the examples on this page, we changed the public and private keys for the `user1_pub` and `user1_priv_entity` (the PKCS12 certificate and key, using the password Axway), where the corresponding example passphrase is `m8ZWaOMdkj70UzJZD+wv8gSsi1ycSTEJ5c0H6SH6dLE=.`

As the private key `user1_priv` is referenced in` enfile_cms.xms` file , you must change the passphrase in the `<signature>` section as follows:
