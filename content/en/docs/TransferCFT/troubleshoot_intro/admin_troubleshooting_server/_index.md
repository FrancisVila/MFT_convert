-   Configuration and production issues

Possible corrective actions include:

-   Collect system information - you can use either the <span class="mc-variable Primary.CG or_UM variable">Central Governance</span> interface, or from Transfer CFT use [cft\_support](../../cft_intro_install/unix_install_start_here/troubleshoot_registration/support_tools)
