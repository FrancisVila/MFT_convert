}If error messages display when loading the profile, for example "CFTDIRDATÂ parameter not set", the error may be due to a new file in the $CFTDIRRUNTIME/profile.d directory. An example of this is <span class="code">cft-autocomplete.bash\_completion</span>, which was introduced in <span class="mc-variable suite_variables.TransferCFTName variable">Transfer CFT</span> 3.3.0.

To fix this issue, you can run the following command :


    cftruntime -p $CFTDIRINSTALL $CFTDIRRUNTIME

This command saves the current profile and creates a new one. You can compare the previous profile file with the new one, and keep the file you require.
