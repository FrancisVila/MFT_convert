}Transfer CFT generates messages that provide information about the processes
and events that occur on the Transfer CFT. These messages are collected and
stored in a log file. If you are using Central Governance, in the **Products List** page select the Transfer CFT in question. In the Transfer CFT page, select **Logs** in the right pane to view the Transfer CFT logs.

Transfer CFT also generates messages that provide information about
the state of a transfer. These messages are collected and stored in a
catalog file. From the Central Governance main menu, select **Flow** &gt; **Monitoring** &gt; and then the type of View, for example **View all flows in error for a given application**.

All Transfer CFT error messages and diagnostics are listed in the section
[Messages
and error codes](messages_and_error_codes_start_here). If an error occurs in Transfer CFT that you cannot
correct using the diagnostic information provided there, see
**Performing checks** below.

As you go through the questions in **Performing checks**, note your responses. If you need to submit
a Support request this information can help you to save time.

[Documentation](#Finding_OS_specific_relevant_information) lists related documentation that you may want to consult.

To better help you resolve an incident, you can print and use
the following table. It can serve as a guideline for gathering information, which can help you if you need to file an incident report.
