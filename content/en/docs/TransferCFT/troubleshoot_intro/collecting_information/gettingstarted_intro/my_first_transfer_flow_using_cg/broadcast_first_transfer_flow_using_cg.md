}Broadcast and collect modes allow you to send files to multiple partners and receiving files from multiple partners using a single command request for each.

Broadcast
---------

You can use broadcasting to send a file to an entire group of partners in one command, avoiding the task of sending the selected file individually to each of the partners in a flow.

The name of the broadcast list is itself a virtual partner, which contains a list of partners in your flow. This list of partners can be explicit, or it can reference a file that contains the list of partners.

Additionally, you can define what occurs if a partner is unknown, how the scripts are applied to the broadcast list, and so on. [More information](../../../../../concepts/transfer_command_overview/broadcast_collect)...

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1<br/>  | Create a flow.<br/> <br/> <br />  | In {{< TransferCFT/PrimaryCGorUM  >}} click ****Flows**** &gt; ****Add flow****.<br/> Create a flow named ****Broadcast_flow****, and give it the identifier ****flow04****.<br/> In this flow the MainOffice is the Source with the two stores as the Targets. | <a href="../intro_cg_task_catalog/t_defineflow_broadcast">![](/Images/TransferCFT/mapArrow.png)</a>  |
| 2<br/>  | Enable broadcasting mode.<br/>  |  <br/> In the Source Transfer properties, enable Broadcast list.<br/>  | <a href="../intro_cg_task_catalog/t_defineflow_broadcast#enable_broadcast_cg">![](/Images/TransferCFT/mapArrow.png)</a>  |

| 4<br/>  | Create a file for the flow.<br/>  | For this example, copy a file SALES_report to transfer in the Store_66 {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName  >}}<code> runtime/pub </code>folder.<br/>  |   |
| 5<br/>  | Execute the SEND command.<br/>  | From the source {{< TransferCFT/axwayvariablesComponentShortName  >}}, run the following command:<br/> <code>CFTUTIL SEND PART=DEST_stores, IDF=flow04, FNAME=pub/SALES_report</code><br/>  | <a href="../../../../../c_intro_userinterfaces/about_cftutil">![](/Images/TransferCFT/mapArrow.png)</a>  |

Collect
-------

Collecting files is the inverse of using a broadcast list. In the collect transfer mode you can receive a dedicated file from multiple partners (P*n*). This allows the receiver, or flow initiator, to receive a file from all defined partners using a single request command. More information...
