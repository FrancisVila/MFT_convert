The default value that specifies how much detail  {{< TransferCFT/componentshortname  >}} should
provide Sentinel concerning transfers with a partner who does

-   **NO**: the monitor never sends Tracked
    Instances to Sentinel. Default value.
-   <span style="font-weight: bold;">ALL</span>: for each step of each transfer
    process, the monitor sends a Tracked Instance to Sentinel.
-   <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY</span>: for both the initial step and
    the final step of each transfer process, the monitor sends a Tracked Instance
    to Sentinel.
