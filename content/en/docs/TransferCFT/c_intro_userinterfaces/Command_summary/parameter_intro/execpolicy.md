#### CFTCRON

`EXECPOLICY = = [ INSTANCE |ALLNODES ]`

The `execpolicy `defines the node policy for executing a job when working with multiple nodes. You can use this parameter to avoid issues that could occur due to a shared file.

- Instance: one of the Transfer CFT{{< TransferCFT/componentshortname >}} nodes is responsible for performing the job
- Allnode: every node does the job
