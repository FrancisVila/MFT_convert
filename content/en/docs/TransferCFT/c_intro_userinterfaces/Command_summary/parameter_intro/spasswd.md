#### CFTSEND/CFTRECV

\[ SPASSWD = *string* , \_AUTH\_\]

Password for the user who is sending the file. You can provide the SPASSWD directly or through an external file, and uses the following format:

part1 user1 passwd1

part2 user2 passwd2

\* user1 passwd3

\* \* passwd4

Or you can use \_AUTH\_ to indicate authentication method as defined in the uconf <span class="code">cft.server.authentication\_method</span> parameter.

Example

<span class="code">/home/&USERID/cft\_passw</span>

> **Note:**
>
> If you begin a password with an indirection character (Unix @, Windows #), it is considered a reference to a file and not part of the password.
