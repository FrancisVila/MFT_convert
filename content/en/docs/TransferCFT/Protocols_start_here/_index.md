}## File transfer protocols

A file transfer protocol is
a set of rules governing connections and file-based data interchange between
remote sites. The sequence of connection messages, file selection, data
transfer, synchronization points and disconnect requests must be defined
and recognized by both Partners.

Transfer CFT uses a specific network access
method, and one of the following file transfer protocols
to communicate with Partner objects:

-   [PeSIT](about_pesit)
-   [ODETTE](start_here_odette)
-   [SFTP](sftp_intro)

This
section introduces Transfer CFT transfer processor concepts. Before beginning you should be familiar with basic Transfer
CFT concepts, mechanisms, parameters and protocol concepts.
