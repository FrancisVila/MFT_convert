}## About TARGET2

TARGET2 is the European Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system which, since November 2007, replaces the TARGET system. TARGET2 is based on the Single Shared Platform (SSP), developed by Banca d’Italia, Banque de France, and Deutsche Bundesbank. These three banks operate the system on behalf of the Eurosystem. TARGET2 participants access the SSP using the SWIFT messaging services: FIN, FIN Copy, InterAct, FileAct and Browse.

## About QT2

Query Target2 (QT2) is the mechanism that enables a client application to access a TARGET2 platform. It enables the client application to handle the XML messages specifically adapted to TARGET2 exchanges.
