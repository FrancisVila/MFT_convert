}To run the TARGET2 module in simulation mode, a SWIFT loop configuration must be possible in which you send messages/files to yourself. Users must have access to a SWIFT InterAct service and a SWIFT identity that allows them to send InterAct to themselves.

The file sent to the simulation (InitialRequest.xml in the example) can have any content. The only requirements are:

-   The file must be embedded:
    -   File content must be contained between the tags <span class="code">&lt;SwInt:RequestPayload></span> and <span class="code">&lt;/SwInt:RequestPayload></span>
    -   File content must not conflict with XML parsing
-   The file must be an XML file. For example, you could use the <span class="code">InitialRequest.xml</span> file provided in the QT2 directory
