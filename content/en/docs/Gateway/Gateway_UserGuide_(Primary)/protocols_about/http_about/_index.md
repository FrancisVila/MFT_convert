### HTTP Introduction

The **H**yper<span style="font-weight: bold;">t</span>ext <span style="font-weight: bold;">T</span>ransfer <span style="font-weight: bold;">P</span>rotocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol, used as a generic protocol for communication between users, proxies, or gateways and other Internet systems.

Gateway implements both HTTP/1.0 client and server specifications. Configuration of the relevant objects for HTTP depends on whether you are using Gateway in server mode or client mode.

#### How does HTTP work?

HTTP is a client/server protocol based on a simple request-response dialog. As a stateless protocol, HTTP requires that every request sent by a client contain all the information (for example, identification parameters) necessary for the server to execute it. A complete dialog, which is always initiated by the client, consists of one request and one response.

Sometimes one or more intermediaries, such as a proxy, firewall, or gateway, are present in the request/response chain.

To end an HTTP session the client takes no explicit action as the connection is closed after each request/response dialog pair.

### HTTP and Gateway

You can use HTTP in Gateway to:

-   Send and receive files in client and server mode
-   List available files or transfers
-   Customize error pages and PUT command results
-   Access virtual file directories via the Gateway GUI

Gateway enables you to implement routing and execute user exits when sending or receiving transfers.
