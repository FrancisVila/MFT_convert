}## About the HostGroup object

A HostGroup is an organizational object that you can use to group a set of Host objects. A HostGroup typically represents a geographical site, such as Times Square, Rome or Alaska. Alternatively, it can represent a functional group, such as Accounting.

## Procedure

1.  In the Composer Topography workbench,
    select **File > New > Topography > Hostgroup**.  
    Composer displays the HostGroup properties window.
2.  Complete the following fields of the **General** tab:
    -    **Name** – Enter a name for the HostGroup.
    -   ** Label** – Optionally, enter a free-text description for this HostGroup
    -   **Parent HostGroup** – From the drop-down list, select a parent HostGroup for this object. By default, this value is set to the name of the HostGroup that is selected in the left pane when you create the new HostGroup.   
3.  From the **File** menu, select:
    -   **Save** to save the object definition in the Composer database.
    -   **Close** to close the object properties window.
