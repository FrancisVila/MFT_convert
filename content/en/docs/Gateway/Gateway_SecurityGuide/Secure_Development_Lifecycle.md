}Axway implements a Secure Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) in the development of its main products. This SSDLC is similar to the one defined by Microsoft. A dedicated team, the SSG (Software Security Group), in association with the product development teams, is in charge of managing this SSDLC.

The secure development lifecycle consists of standardized process flows during the development lifecycle. The SSDLC process is a spiral development model. Axway works within this model and with an Agile development model to deliver the required security artifacts for the SSDLC. The following depicts the simplified Microsoft SSDLC model.

Axway implements many SSDLC process and control points. Some important steps along the path to secure product delivery include the creation of both security and design requirements as well as the associated design-time threat models. These steps ensure that products meet initial specifications and that the posited security designs pass all the threat model criteria established both within the security community and with the Axway PSG.

At Axway, there are a broad suite of tools associated with the implementation and verification phases of the SSDLC. Both static and dynamic analysis tools are run to identify potential code weaknesses and to discover security issues potentially exposed at runtime. Suites of attack surface tools and penetration testing tools are run to ensure the deployed products on the target platforms meet gated criteria in the SSDLC and criteria provided by the internal PSG. Axway provides tool suite information and our customized usage profiles upon customer request. Well-known security industry-standard tools are used as well as many other enhanced test scenarios required by our most security-conscious customers.

The new product introduction (NPI) process at Axway requires a final security review with associated development and testing artifacts. This NPI process supports the release of new products or major product revisions. The NPI also ensures the SSDLC is started early in development to optimize the delivery of secured products for you, our customer.
