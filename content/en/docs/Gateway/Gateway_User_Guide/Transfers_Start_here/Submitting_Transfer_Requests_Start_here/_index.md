## About transfers

You can use Gateway to create three types of transfer:

### 1. File transfers

The principle activity of Gateway is to handle the exchange of files between Sites. To execute a file transfer from Gateway, you create and submit a Transfer Request.

### 2. Application message transfers

When Gateway is configured to use the PeSIT protocol, you can send limited-length messages to a Remote Site. To do this, use the Application Message transfer function. This function enables you to send a short text message.

### 3. Acknowledgement message transfers

After receiving a File transfer from a Remote Site, you may need to return an acknowledgement message to the sending machine. To do this, create a message text and associate it with the local ID of the received Transfer Request. You can enter the acknowledgement text directly in the acknowledgement transfer, or alternatively, associate a file containing the message text. You can pre-program the date and time when the acknowledgement message is to be sent.
